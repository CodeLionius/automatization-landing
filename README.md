# AI Automatization Landing Page

A modern, responsive landing page for an AI automation service, built with React and TypeScript. This project is designed to showcase features, collect user feedback, and provide a professional web presence for AI-driven business solutions.

## Features
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Multi-language support (English & Lithuanian)
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Feedback/contact form integration (Tally) with robust reloading (always visible when navigating)
- Interactive calculators (ROI, AI Automation Value) in both EN and LT
- Easy deployment to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
- Unit tests with React Testing Library

## App Architecture & Logic
- **App.tsx** is the main entry point, handling routing, language switching, and state for privacy/calculator modals.
- **Navigation**: All main sections (Home, Features, Contact Us, Calculators) are accessible from the header and mobile menu. Language can be switched at any time.
- **Tally Feedback Form**: The contact form is embedded via iframe and is always reloaded when navigating to the feedback section, ensuring it is never blank or stuck (even after switching sections or languages).
- **Calculators**: Two calculators (ROI and AI Automation Value) are available in both English and Lithuanian. The correct version is shown based on language and user selection.
- **Localization**: All UI text is managed via a single translations file. Adding new languages is straightforward.
- **Footer**: Contains company info, privacy policy, and quick links (no calculator link).
