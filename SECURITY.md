# Security Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the LandingPage-AI_Automatization project and provides guidelines for secure deployment and maintenance.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implemented in `public/index.html`
- Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
- Prevents XSS attacks

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs in calculator tools are validated and sanitized
- Character limits and HTML entity encoding implemented
- Protection against XSS and injection attacks

### 3. Iframe Security
- Sandbox attributes applied to all iframes
- Referrer policy configured
- Frame sources restricted to trusted domains

### 4. External Script Security
- Tally script loading includes error handling
- Cross-origin and referrer policies configured
- Fallback mechanisms in place

### 5. Error Handling
- Global error boundary component
- No sensitive information exposed in error messages
- Development vs. production error display

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest secure versions
- [ ] Run security audit: `npm audit`
- [ ] Test CSP configuration
- [ ] Verify environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Review and update `.env.example`

### Production Configuration
- [ ] Set `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` in production
- [ ] Configure web server security headers (see `.htaccess`)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Configure proper CORS policies
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Test all functionality with security headers enabled
- [ ] Verify external integrations work correctly
- [ ] Monitor for CSP violations
- [ ] Regular security reviews and updates

## Security Best Practices

### Code Review
- Always review external script integrations
- Validate all user inputs
- Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Use TypeScript for better type safety

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production

### Environment Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Separate development and production configurations

## Incident Response
If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@yourdomain.com
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before public disclosure

## Regular Security Tasks

### Weekly
- [ ] Check for dependency updates
- [ ] Review access logs for anomalies

### Monthly
- [ ] Run full security audit
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Review and update CSP if needed

### Quarterly
- [ ] Security architecture review
- [ ] Penetration testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Update security training materials
